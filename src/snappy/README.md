![snappy-c](http://halobates.de/snappy-c.png)

This is a C port of the google snappy compressor (http://code.google.com/p/snappy/)
The compressor is very fast with reasonable compression ratio.
It is mainly useful for projects that cannot integrate C++ code, but want snappy.
Also contains a command line tool, a benchmark, random test code and a fuzz tester.

The compression code supports scather-gather and linear buffers. The scather
gather code is ifdefed (-DSG) and can be removed with unifdef.

API documentation: http://halobates.de/snappy.html

To generate the documentation run

	make html

Requires the kerneldoc script from a Linux kernel source (may need to point
the makefile to it). If you don't have the kernel source lying around
just download it from
https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/scripts/kernel-doc
and point the Makefile to it.
